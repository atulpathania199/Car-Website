Some of the companies we negotiate with in Auckland include international brands like Hertz and Thrifty, as well as national suppliers such as Ezi Car Rental and GO Rentals.

Top Tips

    The roads leading in and out of Auckland city centre can get heavily congested from 4-6pm.
    Some roads in and around the city are tolled. Please check with your car hire company how these will be paid for as they all have different terms.
    During weekends and in the evening, the police are regularly out in force conducting breathalyser tests on drivers. It is recommended not to consume any alcohol if driving.Which companies offer best value in Auckland?

Some rental companies (such as Thrifty, Ezi Car Rental and Ace Rental Cars) have special offers on their cars — so you get an ‘extra’, like additional drivers or a guaranteed make and model included in the price. We tell you exactly what you get for your money upfront, so there are no nasty surprises when you get to the pick-up counter. Don’t forget to look at the ratings and reviews left by previous customers next to each listing, so you get honest, impartial advice before you commit to a booking.

Piha Beach: Located only 40 kilometres from Auckland is Piha beach — one of New Zealand’s most famous surf spots. Piha is a black-sand beach that is known to be moody, misty and windswept. Popular with seasoned surfers, this beach is uncrowded and is great for swimming in the summer months. If you don’t want to sit on the beach, take the Kitekite track up to a dramatic waterfall.

Hobbiton Movie Set: Take a dive to Middle Earth. Only a two-hour drive away is the Shire, home of the Hobbits. The Hobbiton Movie Set was used in Peter Jackson’s adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. On your visit, you can take a look at Bag End (the home of Frodo and Bilbo Baggins) and visit the likes of the Green Dragon Inn and The Mill.

Ambury Farm: Head over to Ambury Farm in Ambury Regional Park for a great family day out. Spend the day at this working farm and help feed the lambs. You can also get up close to pigs, cows, peacocks and chickens (or chooks as they are known in New Zealand).Which companies offer best value in Auckland?
